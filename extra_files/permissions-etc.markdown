Do the following tasks in order to allow certain people access to the Document Requeue Job (change names for your own institution):

1. Create new BSA role 'UA EA Business Analyst'.
2. Create new permission to submit the KFS-RQ batch requeue job.
3. Assign the permission to the UA EA Business Analyst role.
4. Create new group 'UA EA Business Analysts'.
5. Assign the group to the UA EA Business Analyst role.

Also:

Create a new view batch permission for the KR-RQ namespace and assign it to the UA EA Business Analyst role so the business analysts can see the log for the requeue job.
